On Wednesday, oil prices eased paring the previous day’s gain as fears over a global economic slowdown denting fuel demand outweighed expectations of tighter supply due to output cuts announced by top exporters Saudi Arabia and Russia for August.  

Brent crude was down 14 cents, or 0.2 per cent, at $76.11 a barrel by 0027 GMT, after climbing $1.60 on Tuesday. 

US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $71.14 a barrel, up $1.35, or 1.9 per cent, from Monday’s close, having traded through a US holiday to mark Independence Day without a settlement. 

Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest crude exporter, on Monday said it would extend its voluntary output cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) to August, while Russia and Algeria volunteered to lower their August output and export levels by 500,000 bpd and 20,000 bpd, respectively.
